    <h2>Hello Everyone!</h2>
    <p>My name is Kacie Kasner, and I am new to Eleven Fifty Academy. I am approaching 30 and ready to do something with my life.  I have taken coding classes before, but  never gotten a degree.
        My hope is to reimmerse myself in coding and actually do something with it this time around! I love coding because its like solving a puzzle and putting pieces together to make something wonderful.
        There is nothng more satisfying than seeing your finished product and knowing you created that!
    </p>
